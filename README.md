This repository contains files to run GLM on Lough Feeagh Ireland. It is equipped with the basic code to run GLM and to calibrate it against observations. Test period: 2008 - 2013 but can be run in any other period if observations are available.
The code is ready to be run in R, locally.
RMSEs are calculated before and after calibration.
nml files are updated after a run so be sure to download the files and save your tests/runs.
Any question or inquiry please email: ricardo.marroquinpaiz@dkit.ie
